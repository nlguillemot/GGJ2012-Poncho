Submission for Global Game Jam 2012 and first python program

Programmed with Brandon Duncan, as an effort to learn python together. The art was done by Jake, an American artist who communicated with us through skype.

Since this is our first experiment with python, there are some questionable programming practices used in the code.

Requires pygame to run.
